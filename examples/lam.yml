# Example LambdaDelta YAML Configuration
# This file is documentation; It is not expected to be usable as-is.

# Top-level keys control who parses what.
# There are no values at the top level, only sequences or mappings.

# Global LambdaDelta settings
lam:
  # Working Directory (where to chdir for to access disk/rom/tape images)
  wd: /usr/local/whatever/etc
  # File to use for physical keyboard IO
  kb_file: /dev/ttySX
  # Baud rate to use for physical keyboard IO
  kb_baud: 9600  

# Logging settings
log:
  # Key is either a logtype (see logtype_name in kernel.c) or ALL
  # Value is the logging level to use
  # Value of 0 = Minimal logging
  # Value of 10 = Maximum logging
  ALL: 0

# Keyboard settings
keyboard:
  # Whether or not to respect the SDL_QUIT event. (on/true/yes or off/false/no)
  quit: on
  # keyboard/mouse input frame rate
  input_fps: 60
  # Map decimal SDL keycode or key name "foo" (see the SDL documentation)
  # to octal Lambda keycode or key name "bar" (see doc/KEYCODES)
  map: foo bar
  map: F8 Page
  # Mapping as a sequence can also go here
  # Values as above
  mapping:
    - sdl: F8
      lambda: Page
    - sdl: x
      lambda: a
    - sdl: y
      lambda: b
    - sdl: z
      lambda: c

# SDU settings
sdu:
  # The SDU rotary switch position (0 = new install, 1 = default, other positions non-normal - see SDU documentation)
  switch: 1

# Video settings
video:
  # SDL video frame rate
  video_fps: 20
  # SDL framebuffer pixel values
  # Note that on/off means 1/0 in the Lambda's 1bpp framebuffer,
  # not the actually displayed value when the Lambda framebuffer's
  # polarity switch is taken into consideration.
  pixel-on: 0xFFFFFFFF
  pixel-off: 0x00000000
  # window height. 800 is the default, and the other useful value is 1024 (to get larger, microcode changes are needed).
  # Use (TV:SET-CONSOLE-SIZE width height) to change the LispM view.
  height: 800

# Audio settings, only available when using SDL2 (where BEEP is implemented)
audio: 
  # Volume factor, from 0.0 to 1.0. I like 0.3.
  volume: 1.0

# Mouse settings
mouse:
  # Mouse mode:
  # 0 = direct (capture the mouse and drive the VCMEM serial port when it moves)
  # 1 = shared (push the host's window-relative mouse position into A-memory)
  mode: 1
  # A-Memory locations for Mode 1.
  # lambda: which processor (for 2x2)
  # xloc: X position location
  # yloc: Y position location
  # wake: Actvity flag location
  locs:
    - lambda: 0
      xloc: 0156
      yloc: 0157
      wake: 0170
    - lambda: 1
      xloc: 0156
      yloc: 0157
      wake: 0170  

# Networking settings
network:
  # The network interface to use
  interface: ldtap
  # The Lambda's MAC address
  address: 00:02:9C:55:89:C6
  # Alternatively, to avoid collisions (and manual configuration)
  # if you run more than one lam process on your network,
  # you can specify LAA to generate a random
  # Locally Administered Address, which is saved persistently
  # in the file $interface.LAA.
  # (This uses the interface name defined when parsing the address setting,
  # so have the "interface:" before "address: LAA")
  address: LAA
  # The Lambda's guest IP if you are using UTUN (otherwise undefined key)
  guest-ip: aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd

# Disk settings
disk:
  # Units can be specified in one line.
  # This is mostly so they can be specified on the command line.
  # Parameters are the unit number and image file name.
  image: 0 disk.img
  image: 1 disk2.img
  # They can also be specified as a sequence
  # unit = which drive
  # file = image file
  units:
    - unit: 0
      file: disk.img
    - unit: 1
      file: disk2.img
